## Troubleshooting Notes
- Make sure that you start vs code from the src/firstcore folder - otherwise it won't find the settings file (that I created) and won't debug.
- install packagages with ```dotnet restore```
- build with ```dotnet build```
- run with ```dotnet run```
- Good CLI reference [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/core/tools/)

- Learn [Unit Testing](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/tree/master/samples/core/getting-started/unit-testing-using-dotnet-test)
